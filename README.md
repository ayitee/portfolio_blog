# Portfolio Blog

## What is this?

This is V2 of my portfolio website, being built as we speak, with much needed cleaner looks AND CODE, though heavily inspired by Brittany Chiang's.

V3 Will feature a more personal and thought out look, less heavily impacted by inspirations, as this version serves the purpose of a temporary solution, with BTS season coming soon.

## How does it work?

The site is organized into modular sections:
- About
- Experience
- Projects
- Blog

Each section is implemented as a reusable React component, styled with Tailwind CSS for consistency and flexibility. The design emphasizes clarity, minimalism, and smooth user interactions.

## Styling

The website uses Tailwind CSS with a custom color palette:

- Primary: Slate tones
- Accent: Teal
- Background: Dark slate
- Text: Light slate

Feel free to Customize theme in src/app/globals.css and component files.

## Technology

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Inter font
- Vercel (recommended for deployment)

## Deployment

This site can be deployed to any Node.js-compatible platform. For more details, see the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying).

## Inspiration

Design and structure mainly inspired by [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/).
